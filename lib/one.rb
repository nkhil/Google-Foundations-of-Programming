# Given a string S and a set of words D, 
# find the longest word in D that is a subsequence of S.

# Word W is a subsequence of S if some number of characters, 
# possibly zero, can be deleted from S to form W, without reordering the remaining characters.

# For example, given the input of S = "abppplee" and D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"} the correct output would be "apple"


# If youâ€™re stuck from the outset: 
# Suppose you were to just check each 
# dictionary word one at a time to see 
# if it's a subsequence. How would you do that?

# {
  #   a: 0
  #   p: 2
  #   p: 3
  #   l: 5
  #   e: 6
  # }
