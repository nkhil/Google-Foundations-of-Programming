# Google Foundations of Programming Quiz 1

Paired with [Ibrahim](https://github.com/ibrahimbutt/) to complete the first quiz from [Google's Foundations of programming](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/)

## Written in Ruby, TDD using Rspec

## Find longest word in dictionary that is a subsequence of a given string

Given a string `S` and a set of words `D`, find the longest word in `D` that is a subsequence of `S`.

Word `W` is a subsequence of `S` if some number of characters, possibly zero, can be deleted from `S` to form `W`, without reordering the remaining characters.

Note: `D` can appear in any format (list, hash table, prefix tree, etc.)

For example, given the input of `S = "abppplee"` and `D = {"able", "ale", "apple", "bale", "kangaroo"}` the correct output would be "apple"
